# BlindfoldedRunner

### By: Ben Schwartz

BlindfoldedRunner is a simple high school C++ project that simulates a blindfolded runner running through a field. The project follows the specifications outlined in the attached PDF. 

Please note that this is a small project and was designed to be a learning experience. This repository contains the main branch which is the latest version of the code. 

To use BlindfoldedRunner, please clone the repository and compile the code in your C++ development environment. Since this project is complete and small in scope, we anticipate full functionality.
